It is a clone of Tetris Game, written in Assembly, designed for the 16-bit IAPx8088 processor. DOSBox (Disk Operating System) that allows you to run software designed for MS-DOS on modern operating systems (i.e. your system), NASM (Netwide Assembler) is used to assemble the files (i.e. convert them into machine code) and AFD (Advanced Full Screen Debugger) can be used as assembly debugger.
